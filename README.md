# alignbottom.js
Aligns elements to the bottom of their offset container without disrupting the layout and preserving applied styles

## Requirements
jQuery 1.4+

## Use
Simply call `.alignBottom()` on the element (or elements) you wish to align to the bottom of its container.  
The element will be positioned relative to its offset parent and the script will insert a dummy element in place of the element positioned.

There are no options for the script at this time.

## Example
`$('.someElement').alignBottom();`
